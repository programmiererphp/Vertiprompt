VertiPrompt
===========

VertiPrompt is a prompt-engineering companion that:

1. digests a natural-language product or portal description;
2. researches edge-cases, failure modes and domain constraints;
3. outputs an ordered backlog of **lean vertical slices** – self-contained, end-to-end tasks you
   can paste straight into agents like All-Hands, Lovable, Replit AI, Firebase Studio or
   GitHub Copilot-workspace;
4. tracks execution status and iteratively refines prompts as your codebase evolves.

Why?
----

- **No more “big-bang” specs** – build value in increments the agent can own from DB to UI.
- **Agent-optimised format** – every slice ships with:
  * a goal statement
  * acceptance tests
  * UI/UX constraints
  * rollback / hot-reload tips
  * guard-rails for cost, token-budget and latency
- **Human-friendly diffs** – generated in markdown first so reviewers stay in the loop.
